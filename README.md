## Introduction

Guide for the model and programing use by the team kwon as walli 01 bvp.
A contraction we will make a brief description of this robot designed so that it meets the requirements that are in the rules presented in the general document of the category future engineers of the World Robot Olympiad™ in a concise and precise way using the different types of functions that provide us the different parts. This document will talk about its construction, programming, code and mainly  the objective to be completed in each of these  rounds and what solution we devise for each of these, the code we use, and how this relates to the electromechanical parts of our robot. 
First the robot under discussion is the lego mindstorm robot inventor (51515) this consists of 4 motors (electromechanical parts) and includes two sensors these being an ultrasonic sensor  and a light sensor. And in this construction called walli  in specific would be using an engine for the steering in the front of the vehicle called engine  B and a propulsion engine in the rear of the vehicle called  engine A and apart would be used the light sensor which is called sensor   D, all these parts interconnected with each other with the main brain of the robot or also called "hub".
The objectives to be completed are the following: 
1.	Take three laps to a track of 3x3 meters without having any contact with the edges or black walls that are on the edge of the entire track indicating the limits of the track. Having an outer edge and an internal edge, these cannot be touched while the evaluation or competence has begun.
Our solution for this first challenge: 

To begin with, we had in mind that the light sensor detects the color of the lines, in this case the blue and orange line, but werealize that the sensor detects it, but the signal is weak since the track material reflects a lot of the light emitted by the sensor we are using,  if it is the case  that the sensor does not detect the colors of the line and does not get to activate the  programming then we have a plan B, which consists of using the light sensor to detect  the black  wall that limits the map. For  this we would use the light sensor that when detecting a reflection of light less than 3% this apart from decreasing the speed of the motion motor would also make it seem to have more control of the handle then would give a brief turn in the steering motor and would advance to reposition itself and be able to continue normally with the route and this process would be repeated as many times as necessary during the duration of the travel of the 3 laps.  Although we have one last idea if none of these plans come to work because our last resort would be to make the robot rotate until it completes its objective which is to make 3 laps of the track without having contact with the walls that are on the edge of the track and inside the track. Our goal is to complete the 3 laps without having contact with any obstacles
This for the first round 

For the second
In this round appear new obstacles that appear randomly in different locations on the  map therefore  we have a new objective which is to dodge them and avoid leaving these obstacles outside the circle in which they are located, and of course as the indications ask us that we have to dodge them in specific directions depending on the color,  that in this case would be  red and green, if the traffic light or obstacle  is red  the robot should turn right and if it is green the robot should do the opposite, it would turn left.
Our solution for this second challenge:

We would start by using the same strategy of the previous challenge where we use the light  sensor that when detecting a reflection of light less than 3% this apart from decreasing the speed of the motion motor would also make it seem to have more control of the manobra then would give a brief turn in the steering motor and would advance to reposition itself and be able to continue normally with the route and this process would be repeated as many times are necessary, and apart from this programming we would add one more for the identification and circumvention of the new obstacles, where the light sensor when detecting some of the colors this would send the  signal to motor A to reverse and then stop so that  it gives enough space to the robot to maneuver correctly, then the order would be given to motor B to adjust so that the robot advances respectively to the  left or to the right depending on this factor of the color of the obstacle, then the order would be given to motor A to advance to a certain point where it does not represent a danger to the integrity of the  pillars,  And at this point the robot would be ready to resume its normal route until it encounters another obstacle. And in any case that this strategy did not work we would take the same base but instead of also using the light sensor to avoid colliding against the edges, only the robot would be programmed so that when starting the engine B it suffers a small adjustment in its orientation and that the robot only turns on the track until it encounters an obstacle where the same programming indicated for this purpose would be resumed. In the previous plan, and despite any correction that is made to the programming then these last two plans for the second round came to fail we would only have to try that the robot only turns the track that does not collapse any of the obstacles.

And with this finish us all the  solutions and plans of   the  walli 01 bvp team for the challenges presented in each of the two rounds  in the category known as  "future engineers"  which is part  of the  World Robot Olympiad™,  the instructions in the programming  of each of  these and which would be The objective of each of the  electromechanical  parts present and used in this model and how each one is related to the others to meet the objective proposed in this competition in the most efficient way possible in order to obtain the highest possible score in each of the proposed challenges.
